Windows does not recognize .war files as executable files even when you add read and execute permissions.

The command that needs to be run on Windows for this to work properly is:

java -jar .\jhipster-registry-3.2.4.war --security.user.password=admin --jhipster.security.authentication.jwt.secret=secret-key --spring.cloud.config.server.native.search-locations=file:./central-config
